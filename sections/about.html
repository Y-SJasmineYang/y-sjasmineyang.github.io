<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <p>I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at University College Dublin funded by the UCD School of Economics. My general research area is Behavioral and Experimental Economics, with a foundation in Game Theory.</p> 
    <p>In my work, I design and implement theoretical models and online experiments to study motivation, algorithmic discrimination, and strategic behavior in both labor and dating markets.</p> 
    <p>My current projects explore how hiring algorithms affect workersâ€™ willingness to invest in their skills, how diversity affects trust, and how individuals signal intent under ambiguity on dating platforms.</p>
    <p>Prior to my PhD, I worked in marketing and consulting across East Asia, experiences that continue to shape my interest in applied, policy-relevant research.</p>
    <p>I hold an MSc in Applied Economics from UCD and a BBA in International Business from National Chengchi University, with exchanges to Purdue University and Western Washington University.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Research Interests:</strong> Behavioral Economics, Experimental Economics, Game Theory, Media Economics, Algorithmic Fairness</p>
